 <td><h3>Carbohydrates often get a bad rap, especially when it comes to weight gain. But carbohydrates aren't all bad. Because of their numerous health benefits, carbohydrates have a rightful place in your diet. In fact, your body needs carbohydrates to function well.<br>

But some carbohydrates might be better for you than others. Understand more about carbohydrates and how to choose healthy carbohydrates.<br>
Common sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include:<br>

Fruits<br>
Vegetables<br>
Milk<br>
Nuts<br>
Grains<br>
Seeds<br>
Legumes<br>

carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day.<br>
